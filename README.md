# DL-SCEWIN

SCEWIN is a tool to modify hidden BIOS variables however it is exclusively shipped with MSI Center. This repository was created to provide the SCEWIN binaries without installing the MSI bloatware so that you don't have to.

## Usage

1. Run the ``Export.bat`` script to export NVRAM data to ``BIOSSettings.txt``

2. Depending on the type of variable, move the ``*`` to the desired option or change the value

3. Run the ``Import.bat`` script to write the configuration in ``BIOSSettings.txt`` to NVRAM
